# Diner2.0
Social app for the UMD North Campus Diner

  These files are the contents to a social app I created at the start of the fall term 2017. The general purpose is to aid in locating other friends when the diner is crowded with students. The basic features are hosting a table by inputing your location, finding a table that is being hosted, and adding/removing friends (by email) so that you can view their table. This app takes advantage of Google's Firebase features. 

Getting Started:
  1 - First, Xcode was the tool I used to bring all of these files together and the language used is Swift. Make sure you are familiar with Xcode. 
  2 - Secondly, create a personal account with Firebase. Then follow the steps given to connect your Xcode project to the new Firebase project. 
  3 - For the files that you import to your project, ensure that you do not duplicate the Pod file and make sure to make the necessary adjustments specific to your personal Firebase project. For example, There is a request to the database made in LoginViewController.swift, which contains the URL specific to my project and should be different for yours.
